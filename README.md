# TopDownShooter
 
A 2D wave survival shooter from a top down perspective. Receive random upgrades for each wave you survive, such as damage boosts, movement speed upgrades or firing multiple shots in a spread pattern. 

Currently in a very rough state, needs a lot of UI and code refactoring. Dusting off an old project to polish it and release open source.
